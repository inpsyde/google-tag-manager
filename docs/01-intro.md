# Inpsyde Google Tag Manager

This plugin installs the free Google Tag Manager (GTM) on your WordPress website and writes website data into the data layer. With our plugin "Inpsyde Google Tag Manager" you no longer need to manually change the code in the theme as a user to use the Google Tag Manager. This is done by the plugin, so you can use Google Tag Manager easily and quickly.

The Google Tag Manager is a very helpful tool for website owners and very popular with both online marketing experts and newcomers. If you use Google Tag Manager correctly, it will help you optimize your website.

Easily install all of your marketing and analytics tools through the easy-to-use interface of the Google Tag Manager (GTM) by tagging them in your GTM container as tags or so-called "Code-Snippets". In many cases you do not have to change the code of your website. The wait for the developer has an end.

Not only code snippets for marketing and analytics tools such as Google Analytics or Adwords can be managed through Google Tag Manager, but also any HTML or JavaScript snippets you want to run on your website.

In addition, the Google Tag Manager provides a so-called data layer, which is used to exchange data between your website and the GTM. For example, it could be stored in the Data Layer whether the visitor to your website is logged in or not. You could use this information to execute a tag (for example, the Google Analytics tag) only if the visitor is not logged in.

However, in order for the data to be written to the data layer, this usually needs to be programmed by a developer. And this is exactly where our plugin comes into play a second time and saves you the developer again. Because our plugin "Inpsyde Google Tag Manager" writes certain data for you in the Data Layer, if you want it. You will find out exactly what these are in the section "Data Layer Output".
